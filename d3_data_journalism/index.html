          <h2>Percentage of People Living in Poverty and the Percentage of Those Who Lack Healthcare</h2>
          <p>Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina have the
            highest percentage of people in poverty with the highest percentage that don't have healthcare.
            Based on the chart, one could infer that the percentage of people in states where poverty levels 
            are the highest is related to the percentage of people without healthcare.</p>

          <p>Maryland, Connecticut, North Dakota, Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, and Iowa are the states with the 
            lowest percentage of people in poverty and has the lowest percentage of people without healthcare.
            Wyoming, Alaska, Utah, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, and Nebraska have a relatively low percentage
            of people living in poverty but relatively high percentage of people with no healthcare. For these
            states, the percentage of people living in poverty may not fully encapsulate why people in those states
            are living in poverty.</p>

          <p>Overall, the chart provides only a snapshot and attempts to correlate percentage of people who lack healthcare
            to the percentage of people living in poverty in the U.S. Texas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, South
            Carolina, and North Carolina's data aligns to the initial assumption. Maryland, Connecticut, North Dakota, Hawaii, 
            Minnesota, Vermont, and Iowa's data are also aligned. Wyoming, Alaska, Utah, New Jersey, Virginia, Colorado, and
            Nebraska's data tell a different story. There are more factors potentially that are not accounted for and should be
            explored to provide a more comprehensive view.
